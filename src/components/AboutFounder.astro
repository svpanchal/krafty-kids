          Krafty Kids supports disadvantaged and vulnerable children through art-based enrichment.
          We partner with community organizations to offer hands-on art events that empower underserved youth
          to grow social-emotional skills, self-expression, and community through creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our approach is grounded in research on social-emotional learning and informed by data insights from
          participant feedback. Activities are designed to support emotional development and resilience, and we use
          donated and reusable materials to keep programs sustainable, low-waste, and accessible to every child.
        </p>

        <p>
          Krafty Kids was founded by Maya Panchal, a student volunteer who has spent the past three years leading creative
          sessions for kids in her community. She started Krafty Kids to make these opportunities more consistent and
          more widely available, so more children can experience strength, joy, and connection through art.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-600">
          Outside of Krafty Kids, Maya loves swimming, field hockey, and writing poetry, and she brings that same
          curiosity and care into every session she leads.
